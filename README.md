# Documentation: `FenetreAdmission` Class in C#

## Overview
The `FenetreAdmission` class in the `ProjetHopital` namespace handles the logic for managing admissions in a hospital system.

The class provides methods for creating and searching for patients, validating input, handling admissions, and interacting with various UI components.
